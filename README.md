###Install instructions:
Download the forgeDeobfuscator.jar file from the repository. If your browser automatically cancels the download due to a false positive security flag, you should try installing the forgeDeobfuscator.zip file; both are exactly the same, but with different file formats.

###Optional Steps for Windows Users:

- You can download the runDeobfuscator.bat file to streamline the process of launching the program. All the file does is launch command prompt for you and run the .jar file.
- If you do this, you can just double-click the batch file instead of following the run instructions below; the batch file must be located in the same directory as the .jar file.

###Running the program:

- Open up a Command Line Interface/Terminal/Shell
- Run the following command: `java -jar PATH/forgeDeobfuscator.jar` where PATH is the path for the .jar file; example for a Windows user named Steve who has the file on their desktop: `java -jar C:/Users/Steve/Desktop/forgeDeobfuscator.jar`
- Enter a command to be executed (input the name of the command).
